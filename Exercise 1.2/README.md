<h1>Exercise 1.2</h1>

<h3>Data Structure (recipes)</h3>
<p>
  Dictionary
  <br>
  I selected the dictionary as the data structure because it stores values and objects within itself indexed by keys. The key-value pairs can be easily accessed and updated.

<h3>Data Structure (all_recipes)</h3>
<p>
  List
  <br>
  I chose a list as the data structure because they are mutable. It's easy to add, modify, or sort elements.
