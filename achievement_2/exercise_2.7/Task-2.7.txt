Take some time to think of what you want users to search for, the criterion for search, and format of output.

As someone who has used recipe apps in the past to find easy recipes to make, I would want users to be able to search for recipes by ingredients should they have a main ingredient they want to cook around and the name of the recipe in case there's something specific they're looking for.

Criterion for Search:					Format of Output:
{recipe.ingredients}					name
{recipe.name}						name, ingredients, cooking_time, difficulty
difficulty: "easy", "medium", "intermediate", "hard"	name, ingredients, cooking_time

Data Analysis:
Bar Graph: Display recipe name (x-axis) and cooking_time (y-axis)

Line Graph: Display recipe name (x-axis) and number of ingredients (y-axis)

Pie Chart: Display difficulty of all recipes by total percentage

Execution Flow:
User lands on homepage,
User clicks 'login',
User logs in with username and password,
User lands on list of recipes,
User clicks on a recipe,
User lands on details of selected recipe,
User goes back to list of recipes,
